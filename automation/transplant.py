"""Advance the decomp WITHOUT a model, by transplanting C that already exists.

WHY THIS EXISTS
    The harness spends its budget asking models to rediscover functions. But
    for a large slice of the queue the C already exists somewhere: upstream
    has decompiled 26 of our unmatched functions, and asm_twin_finder found
    174 of 335 stubs have a near-identical twin elsewhere in the tree.

    For those, decompilation is not the problem. Copying is, and a copy is
    verifiable by build rather than by proxy. That makes it strictly better
    evidence than anything a model produces: no fabricated field names to
    detect, no degeneration to abort, no fidelity score standing in for the
    truth. Either the overlay checksums or it does not.

SAFETY
    This does NOT implement apply/build/revert. It calls
    permuter_supervisor.land_match, which is the one sequence in this repo
    hardened against a mid-build crash: it takes the same automation/.build
    .lock the fleet workers hold, journals the original BEFORE writing,
    rebuilds, verifies the 81 SHA-1s independently of make's exit code, and
    reverts unconditionally on anything short of green -- proving the revert
    with _assert_reverted rather than printing the word.

    A second copy of that sequence would be a second thing to get wrong, so
    land_match grew a `body=` parameter instead.

    DRY RUN by default. Nothing touches src/ without --apply.

Usage:
    python3 automation/transplant.py --list
    python3 automation/transplant.py --function <name>            # dry run
    python3 automation/transplant.py --function <name> --apply
    python3 automation/transplant.py --self-test
